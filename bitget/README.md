# Bitget Stock+ US stocks

This group uses the official **Stock+ securities API** at `/api/v3/stockplus`. It supports US stock market and limit orders, position queries, today's orders, cancellation, account/order snapshots and instrument checks. Crypto, Reality/rToken, CFDs, options and foreign-listed securities are excluded. Older `account_type:classic_spot` and crypto-borrow settings fail configuration validation.

Use an API key, secret and passphrase with Stock+ trading/account read permissions, trade-write permission for orders, and Stock+ market-data access for instrument checks. Complete the Stock+ account onboarding and any market-data entitlement requirements with Bitget. `config.example.json` shows the settings; `base_url` defaults to `https://api.bitget.com` and request timeout to 20 seconds.

Supply `AAPL` or `AAPL.US`; the broker payload always uses `AAPL.US`. Quantities are shares for buys and sells, including market buys. Fractional quantities remain decimal strings. A live placement first verifies the requested instrument using Stock+ basic information. `build_order` itself is offline. Quotes/instrument metadata do not prove account-specific trading permission or order acceptance.

Market and limit orders support `day`, `gtc` and `gtd`. GTD requires `options.expire_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. **Native FOK and IOC are not documented and are rejected**; timed cancellation, when separately selected through the shared runtime, allows partial fills and is not true FOK. Other broker-documented conditional order types are reported in capabilities but not submitted by these scripts.

Optional `outside_rth` is `RTHOnly`, `AnyTime` or `Overnight`; the equivalent uppercase underscore forms are accepted. `extended_hours:true` selects `AnyTime`. Extended-session orders must be limits. LULD intent uses regular hours and the shared halt controls. No dedicated Stock+ LULD reopening auction route or guaranteed participation is documented; ordinary eligible limits must not be described as an auction guarantee.

A deterministic `remark` (`cmd:` plus a command-ID hash) correlates submissions. It is **not broker idempotency**. The docs mention `clientOid` in responses/cancellation but omit it from the placement request, so this adapter does not invent one. The local journal provides duplicate protection. Unknown write outcomes require reconciliation; writes are never automatically retried.

Orders for a requested day combine `today-orders` and `history-orders`, deduplicate by exact ID and filter `submittedAt` to the configured day's UTC bounds. Historical `hasMore` splits the inclusive integer-second interval recursively. Live empty history responses may omit `hasMore`; that omission is accepted only with an empty `orders` list. Nonempty pages still require a boolean flag. A single second that still overflows, malformed pagination metadata, excessive windows, or rejected history range fails explicitly. Open-order cancellation queries history from Unix epoch through now as well as today's endpoint, preserving older GTC orders. Broker-side retention cannot be enlarged by this script; a server rejection is not silently replaced with a shorter range.

`positions` reads every account channel from `stock-position` and includes only US stock symbols; snapshots retain the channel, signed share quantity and reported cost. Cancellation resolves an exact order detail, checks the requested symbol and stock instrument, and only then sends a cancel. The acknowledgement alone does not prove cancellation or fills.

The borrow control returns `supported:false`, `status:unavailable` and unknown quantity/rate/shortability. Stock+ supports ETB short selling, but its published API has no stock borrow-availability endpoint. Crypto loan APIs do not answer this query. Tradability reads security metadata and quote status; unknown statuses remain unknown.

Transport uses the documented Bitget HMAC headers and signed JSON POST bodies. The generated Stock+ cURL examples inconsistently put POST parameters in the query string; JSON follows Bitget's general REST contract. Mocked contract tests cover the transmitted bytes, but authenticated live Stock+ acceptance remains to be verified with the user's configured account. No test trades have been placed.

## Five accounts on separate servers

Run one Bitget worker per account, with that account's credentials and routing on
its own server. All five workers subscribe to `trading-commands` on
`45.32.121.19:9092`, each using an independent consumer group. Separate IP
addresses do not create separate Kafka subscriptions: consumers in the same
group share partitions, so one account can otherwise miss its commands.

Each server has its own `/root/bitget-configs/config.properties` and private
`config.json`. Start from the repository's `config.example.json`, then set the
local configuration from these properties:

| Properties entry | Local setting |
| --- | --- |
| `client_id` | Loaded into `BITGET_API_KEY` at startup |
| `client_secret` | Loaded into `BITGET_API_SECRET` at startup |
| `passphrase` | Loaded into `BITGET_PASSPHRASE` at startup |
| `string_id` | `brokers.bitget.routing.account_id` |
| `numerical_id` | `brokers.bitget.routing.account_num_id`, as a positive JSON integer |
| `kafka_ip` | `kafka.bootstrap_servers` |

Keep the credential environment references from the example; credentials stay
out of `config.json`, command-line arguments, and Git. `bitget/start.py` checks
any supplied routing/Kafka properties against `config.json` before connecting,
and rejects mismatches. Older files containing only credentials remain supported.
Give every account a distinct `string_id` and `numerical_id`; command producers
must use those same account selectors.

This server's account is `BITGET_DENGLEI`, numeric ID `2`. Its local configuration
uses `trading_enabled:true` and `journal_account:"BITGET_DENGLEI-stock-plus-live"`.
`BITGET_LYJ`, numeric ID `1`, belongs to a different server and account. Configure
the other three servers from their own properties rather than copying either
account's identity. Give each real account its own permanent `journal_account`
and preserve that label and `.state/` across restarts and credential rotation.

The group format for numeric accounts is:

```text
<group_prefix>.bitget.<account_id>.<server_id-or-default>.<live-or-preview>.<account_num_id>
broker-api-scripts.bitget.BITGET_LYJ.default.live.1
broker-api-scripts.bitget.BITGET_DENGLEI.default.live.2
```

Each group receives the complete command stream and executes only commands
matching its account selectors. For this server, target `account_num_id:2` or
`account_id:"BITGET_DENGLEI"`; if both are supplied, both must match. To trade on
all five accounts, publish one account-addressed command per account. Account
and order snapshots use `account-details` and `order-status` with the same
account identifiers.

Appending the numeric ID changes the Kafka group for existing deployments.
A new group starts at `latest` by default and does not inherit the old group's
offsets. When upgrading an existing worker, stop it first and migrate its
committed offsets if queued commands must be preserved. Keep its original
journals. An older worker on another account can keep its existing group;
it remains independent of this server's new group. Accounts without numeric IDs
retain the previous group format.

After creating the Python environment and installing `requirements.txt`, use
the same generic service on each server:

```bash
cd /root/broker-api-scripts
.venv/bin/python bitget/start.py --check
install -m 0644 deploy/bitget.service /etc/systemd/system/bitget.service
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start bitget
systemctl status bitget --no-pager
journalctl -u bitget -n 50 --no-pager
# To stop after the current operation:
systemctl stop bitget
```

The service runs read-only Kafka, account, order, and instrument checks before
starting the consumer. It does not automatically restart after an authentication
or reconciliation failure and is not enabled at boot. The older
`deploy/bitget-lyj.service` is a legacy unit name; stop that unit before replacing
it with `bitget.service` on the same server. Use only one unit per local account.

Bitget error `40084` means the supplied account is in Classic Account mode and
the requested API requires Unified Account access. Resolve account eligibility
and Stock+ permissions in Bitget, then run the check and start commands above.
Changing the local `account_type` cannot resolve this server-side rejection.

## Start manually with nohup

Install `requirements.txt` in the repository's `.venv` and prepare
`~/bitget-configs/config.json` with the account routing, Kafka settings, permanent
`journal_account`, and credential environment references described above. Keep
the credentials in `~/bitget-configs/config.properties`.

Run the launcher from any working directory:

```bash
~/broker-api-scripts/bitget/start-live.sh
```

The launcher locates the repository relative to itself and checks for an existing
worker. It runs the read-only startup checks with a 180-second timeout; a failed
check stops the launch. Once those checks pass, it sets
`brokers.bitget.trading_enabled` to `true` in the private configuration and starts
`bitget/start.py --execute` in the background using `nohup`, with stdin detached.
Output is appended to `~/bitget-configs/bitget.log`, and the process ID is saved
in `~/bitget-configs/bitget.pid`. The initial process check confirms that the
worker has survived three seconds; inspect its health record for runtime status:

```bash
~/broker-api-scripts/.venv/bin/python ~/broker-api-scripts/tools/runner_control.py status --broker bitget
tail -n 50 ~/bitget-configs/bitget.log
# To stop after the current operation:
~/broker-api-scripts/.venv/bin/python ~/broker-api-scripts/tools/runner_control.py stop --broker bitget
```
